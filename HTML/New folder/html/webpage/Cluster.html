Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically 
designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),
meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically 
compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular 
programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] Java was 
originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core 
component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than 
either of them.
<br />
<br />
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. 
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General 
Public License.

	In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International 
	to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through 
	the Java Community Process.At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, 
	despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for 
	specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
